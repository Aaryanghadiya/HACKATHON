Problem Statement:Build a Skill Swap Platform web application that allows users to create public or private profiles with basic information and manage a list of skills they offer and want
                  Users should be able to search others by skills, send swap requests, accept/reject them, view pending/current swaps, leave feedback after swaps, and delete unaccepted requests.
